# SecureLocker
Due to the frequent need to exchange some confidential information with friends, such as passwords, important files, and digital currency keys. So I specifically wrote a small tool to exchange encrypted data with others.
This software uses asymmetric RSA algorithm to automatically generate key pairs (public key and private key). As long as you send the public key to the other party and they encrypt it with the public key, only you can decrypt it yourself.
Release a version first, take a look at everyone's feedback, and then gradually improve it later.
